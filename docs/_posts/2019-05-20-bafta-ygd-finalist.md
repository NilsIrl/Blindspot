# Why it all started

Five months ago or so, I was told by my computing teacher that willing students
could participate to the [BAFTA Young Game Designer Game Making
Award](http://ygd.bafta.org/) with the help of Harry Petch,
[twice](http://ygd.bafta.org/competition/competition-news/2016/illuminate)
[finalist](http://ygd.bafta.org/competition/competition-news/2019/tempo).

# Making the game

During the following months, I tried to come up with ideas. Very early I had
already the idea of making a game in a dark environment which then shifted to a
game without light at all.

During the last month before the submission, I started making the game using
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and got to finish release
[v0.1](https://github.com/NilsIrl/Blindspot/releases/tag/v0.1).

# The future of the game

If I am writing this, it's because we (with the game) are
[finalist](http://ygd.bafta.org/competition/competition-news/2019/blindspot-0)!!
This has given me more motivation and has made me realised how some parts of the
game are lacking and the potential the game could have for a story.

So I am planning to continue the game once Godot 3.2 comes out. This is because
[a
commit](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/a1fc73e6d3e5aa04b2e93be074a2615a42fb7966)
is required for the game to work and I don't want to continue the game on the
master branch and prefer to work on a stable release.

I plan on adding/changing the following:
* Changing the license to a more restrictive one, I'm thinking of the GPL. This
  also means that I will need to change some assets
* Adding settings. It will be used for the assets and controls
* Adding a story
* Making the game playable on other platforms (MacOS and consoles) and using
  other controls.
* Adding some kind of multiplayer mode
* [Procedurally generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) maps
